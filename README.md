# ToDo-List
This will hopefully be a fully functional To Do List App that can be used to organize and keep track of things .
I am a 3rd quarter programming student just getting my feet wet. This will be my first usable app. 
I will use HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript to get this project functioning.
Uses a custom class and web storage to store TODO Items.
